To fix OSM layers:

/usr/local/lib/python3.5/dist-packages/django/contrib/gis/templates/gis
    var base_layer = new ol.layer.Tile({
        source: new ol.source.OSM()
    });

Check path with:
python3
import django
print(django.__path__)

or better yet...
Put everything in a virtual enviroment

Setting up gis:
Remember to import packages individually:
python3 manage.py makemigrations flintstone

Include GIS in settings.py
And install packages
